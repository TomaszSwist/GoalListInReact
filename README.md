# GoalListInReact
Simple React App that stores goals list.

This is my first React App with logic done entirely by Me (CSS from the course).

GitHub Pages: https://tomaszswist.github.io/GoalListInReact/


The app allows the user to add a goal and delete it.

    Adding a new goal
        Simply type your text into the input field and click the "Add Goal" button.

    Deleting goals
        Simply click on the goal and it will be deleted.


Features:

    You can't add an empty target.
        When you try add an empty goal, the input field will change color to red.
